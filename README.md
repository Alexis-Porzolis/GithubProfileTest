 ðŸ’« **Welcome to my Github profile!**

I am a 24-year-old student, currently in my second year of Information Systems Engineering, with one year of experience as a Data Engineer. My passion for data has led me to focus on data science, driven by its potential to create meaningful change.

With a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, I continue to develop my skills through practical projects. I also place a high value on ethics and transparency in the use of data.

If you share this passion, feel free to reach out. Thank you for visiting my profile!
